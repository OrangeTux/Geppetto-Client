Geppetto Client
===============
A simple, static client for [Geppetto][1], a simple HTTP REST API to interact
with the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi. A [online version][2] is available.
It is mostly for demonstrating how the Geppetto API can be used.

**Note** The online version can't be used on Raspberry Pi's in a local network.
